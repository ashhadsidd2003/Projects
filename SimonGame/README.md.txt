Simon Game 

This is a memory-based game where the computer shows a new random color each round.  

How it works:
- In the first round, one color is shown.  
- In the next round, only the new color is shown (not the full sequence).  
- The player must remember the previous sequence and press all the colors in the correct order.  
- If the sequence is correct, the game continues with a new color added.  
- A wrong move ends the game and it can be restarted.  

Focus:
This project helped me practice:
- JavaScript logic for sequence generation  
- Event handling for user inputs  
- animations and sounds
