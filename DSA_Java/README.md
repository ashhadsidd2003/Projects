DSA in Java

This folder contains implementations of core Data Structures & Algorithms in Java.  
Each file demonstrates a different concept with clean, working code and test cases.


Implementations:

1. Heap Priority Queue
- File: `HeapPriorityQueue.java`  
- Implements a Min-Heap / Priority Queue using arrays.  
- Supports:
  - Insert with priority
  - Remove (extract-min)
  - Sift-up / Sift-down operations  

2. Queue Implementations
- File: `QueueMain.java`  
- Demonstrates the Queue ADT with two implementations:  
  - Linked List based queue (`QueueLL`)  
  - Circular Buffer based queue (`QueueCB`)  
- Includes custom `QueueException` for overflow/underflow handling.  


3. Sorted Linked List
- File: `SortedLL.java`  
- Implements a sorted linked list with a sentinel node.  
- Supports:
  - Insert (keeps order sorted)
  - Remove
  - Check if empty
  - Display contents
