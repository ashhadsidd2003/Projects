C Games and Algorithms

This folder contains small C projects demonstrating fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and fun games.

Files:

1. MergeSort_ClosestPair.c
   - Sorts an array using Merge Sort.
   - Finds the pair of numbers with the smallest difference.
   - Concepts: Divide & Conquer, Array Traversal.

2. NumberGuessingGame.c
   - Random number guessing game.
   - Player has 5 attempts to guess the number (1â€“25).
   - Tracks guess history and gives feedback (too high / too low).
   - Concepts: Random number generation, Arrays, Loops.

3. WordGuessingGame.c
   - Guess the word (like Hangman).
   - 7 attempts allowed to guess characters.
   - Shows correct guesses and underscores for missing letters.
   - Concepts: Strings, Pointers, Loops, Arrays.



Concepts Covered
- Sorting (Merge Sort)
- Searching (Closest pair)
- Game logic with loops
- Random number generation
- String manipulation
