# Projects
This repository contains a collection of my coding projects.  
Some are built completely from scratch, while others are course-based tasks where starter code (like HTML/CSS) was provided and I implemented the functionality (mainly with JavaScript).  
This repo serves as a showcase of my learning and practice work.
