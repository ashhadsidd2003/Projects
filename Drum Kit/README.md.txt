Drum Kit Challenge

An interactive drum kit built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  

Pressing specific keyboard keys will play corresponding drum sounds.  
Clicking on the on-screen drum buttons will also trigger the same sounds.  

This project focuses on practicing event listeners, DOM manipulation, and audio playback in JavaScript.
