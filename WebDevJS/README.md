JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of my coding projects made in JavaScript.  

Some projects are built completely from scratch, while others are course-based tasks where starter code (like HTML/CSS) was provided and I implemented the functionality mainly with JavaScript.  

This repo serves as a showcase of my learning and practice work in front-end development.  

Projects Included
- Drum Kit → Interactive drum sound app using keyboard/mouse events  
- Simon Game → Classic memory game built with JavaScript logic and event handling  
- Mini Blog Application → Simple blogging system using JS + DOM manipulation  
- Portfolio Project → basic portfolio using HTML/CSS,  focuses on design.  


- Each folder contains its own README.md with details
- All projects are designed for practice and learning
